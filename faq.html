                <h2>Game Information</h2>
                <h3>Are the release dates accurate?</h3>
                <p>We work hard to ensure all dates are accurate. Our data is sourced from official publisher announcements, developer press releases, and reputable gaming news outlets. However, game delays are common in the industry, and dates are subject to change without notice.</p>
                
                <h3>Why isn't a specific game listed?</h3>
                <p>We focus on major releases and highly anticipated indie titles. If a game hasn't been announced officially or is very niche, it might not be in our database yet. You can suggest a game by contacting us.</p>
