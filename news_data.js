    summary: "Playground Games confirms the Japan setting, May 19 release date, and a new progression system starting you as a tourist.",
    content: `
      <p>The rumors were true, and the wait is finally over. Playground Games has officially pulled the curtain back on the next chapter of their open-world racing phenomenon. <strong>Forza Horizon 6 is heading to Japan</strong>, bringing the series to its most requested location ever.</p>
      
      <p>Revealed during the Xbox Developer Direct, the game is set to launch globally on <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>. Impatient racers can get behind the wheel four days early, with Premium Edition access starting on <strong>May 15</strong>.</p>
      
      <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2483190/3b8ebc00e4a5a503984d2a523fc07a14612d03e9/ss_3b8ebc00e4a5a503984d2a523fc07a14612d03e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1769736903" alt="News Image" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;" />

      <h3>From Tourist to Legend</h3>
      <p>In a twist to the usual formula, you won't step off the plane as a festival superstar. In simple terms, you start as a tourist. Before you can even officially join the Horizon Festival, you'll need to qualify. It's a return to a more grounded progression system that fans have been asking for.</p>
      
      <p>Once you're in, the goal is to earn wristbands by completing Showcases and the new "Horizon Rush" obstacle courses. Climbing the ranks is the only way to earn the coveted <strong>Gold Wristband</strong>, which grants access to <strong>Legend Island</strong>—an exclusive area filled with high-stakes challenges.</p>

      <h3>Tokyo, Touge, and Tuning</h3>
      <p>The map promises to be Playground's most ambitious yet. The Tokyo region alone is reportedly five times larger than any city in previous games, featuring distinct districts to explore. And essentially, it wouldn't be Japan without the mountains—<strong>Touge racing</strong> is a core focus, pitting players against narrow, winding mountain passes.</p>
      
      <p>At launch, players will have access to over <strong>550 cars</strong>. A cool new feature for collectors is the ability to find aftermarket-tuned cars parked in driveways around the world, allowing you to buy rare, pre-modified vehicles directly from the open world.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Reference to "The Estate"</h3>
      <p>Customization goes beyond cars this time. While you can still buy player houses, FH6 introduces "The Estate"—a large plot of rural land that is fully customizable. You can spend credits to build your own mountain hideaway or construct a private drift track for you and your friends.</p>

      <h3>Community and Platforms</h3>
      <p>Car culture is at the heart of this entry, with new "Car Meet" locations including the Festival, an Alps parking lot, and the legendary Daikoku. These hubs allow you to check out other players' rides and even buy their custom setups.</p>
      
      <p>Microsoft also reconfirmed that while the game launches first on <strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC</strong>, a PlayStation 5 version is in the works for a release later in 2026.</p>
